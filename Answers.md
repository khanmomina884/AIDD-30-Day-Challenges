**AIDD (AI-Driven Development):**  
AI-Driven Development means developers use AI tools as partners to plan, write, test, and improve software much faster and cleaner than doing it alone.



**Human + AI Collaboration Example:**  
A human writes a clear specification in Markdown, and the AI agent (like Claude Code or Gemini CLI) reads the spec and automatically generates the full code while the human supervises and guides it.
