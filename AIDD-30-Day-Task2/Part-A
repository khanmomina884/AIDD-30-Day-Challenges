 Nine Pillars Understanding

1. (a)Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks
better for your growth as a system architect?

Answer :
 AI Development Agents repetitive tasks ko automate karte hain, jese environment setup, boilerplate code, ya testing. Is se developer apna time complex design aur system-level thinking me invest kar sakta hai. Ye growth promote karta hai kyunki ab hum sirf code likhne wale nahi, balki system architect ban kar layers aur interactions ko samajhne wale ban jate hain.

1. (b) Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer

Answer:
Nine Pillars integrated tools aur processes provide karte hain  TDD, AI CLI, specs, agents  jo ek single developer ko poori team ke jese kaam karne ke laayak banate hain. Is se developer apni expertise ko multiple domains me deepen kar sakta hai, bridging knowledge gaps, aur eventually M-Shaped Developer ban jata hai.

Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

2. (a) Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?
Answer:
Vibe Coding me developer bina proper plan aur specs ke bas apni intuition se code karta hai. Ek ya do din ke liye kaam kar jata hai, lekin week ke baad bugs, unclear logic aur maintainability issues samne aate hain.

2. (b) How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?
Answer:
Specification-Driven Development me pehle clear, executable specs likhe jate hain. Ye ensure karta hai ke developer har feature ka intention aur rules samajh kar implement kare. Bugs aur misunderstanding reduce hote hain aur code maintainable banta hai.

 Architecture Thinking

3. (a) How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?
Answer:
Architecture-first thinking me developer sirf code writer nahi hota, balki system-level planner banta hai. Har layer aur module ko design karta hai taake code scalable, maintainable aur efficient ho.

3. (b) Explain why developers must think in layers and systems
Answer:
Layers aur systems me sochne se complexity manage hoti hai. Ek layer change hone par poore system ko impact samajh aata hai. Raw code me sirf functions aur variables likhne se future me integration aur scalability problems aati hain.
